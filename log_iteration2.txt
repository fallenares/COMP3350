## Outstanding bugs and their fixes
So far in this iteration we have fixed all the bugs.

## Design decisions and rationals
1. Implemented pie charts for budget Categories to view to the spending on each budget.

2. Designed 'ViewCard' page which allows user to view the card balance and a line chart of spending for that card over time.

3. Sometimes user may input wrong data, for this reason, we added the update functionality to transactions, cards, and
   budget categories to modify if the user wants.

4. We designed the feature where the user can choose debit or credit while adding a card. This will help the
   users manage both credit and debit cards.

5. A card can be made Inactive manually if that no longer is used. We didn't design the delete card feature as we don't
   want the transactions associated with that card go away.

6. In our app, the card number is intentionally left unchecked, they could be anything that is not null or empty.
   The rational behind this is: there are numerous kinds of "card" numbers, an ordinary MasterCard or Visa have a 16-digit card number,
   while an American Express card have 15, and even some debit cards have 19 digits. There are even some private companies who
   provide a financial product without a legit bank card (namely EQ Bank in Canada and Ant Financial in China).
